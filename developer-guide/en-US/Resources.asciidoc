Development Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We're rather IDE agnostic, so contributors should feel free to use whatever tools they feel most 
comfortable with.  At the time of this writing, the core apiman developers primarily use Eclipse
Kepler.

The core apiman project is built using maven.  Currently we recommend at least version 3.0.3.

And of course you'll need to have git installed if you want to check out the code from github.
