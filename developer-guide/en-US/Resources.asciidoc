Source code for the apiman project web site is here:

The docker files are currently here:

=== Issue Tracking
The apiman project uses JIRA to track issues such as bugs and feature requests.  It's a good place to start
if you're trying to figure out how to get involved!

=== Development Tools
We're rather IDE agnostic, so contributors should feel free to use whatever tools they feel most
comfortable with.  At the time of this writing, the core apiman developers primarily use Eclipse
Kepler.

The core apiman project is built using maven.  Currently we recommend at least version 3.0.3.

http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

And of course you'll need to have git installed if you want to check out the code from github.

=== Building the Project
Building apiman should be a simple matter of doing a standard Maven build:

....
mvn clean install
....

This will do a full build of apiman and execute all unit tests.  However,
the result will not include a ready-to-run version of apiman.  For that, you
may want to try the following:

....
mvn clean install -Pinstall-all-wildfly8
....

This command will do a full apiman build, but will also download WildFly
and install apiman into it.  The result will be a fully configured install of
apiman running in WildFly.  The location of this WildFly install will be here:

....
apiman/tools/server-all/targe/wildfly-{wildfly.version}/
....

At this point you can test apiman by simply running WildFly from the above
location using a command something like this:

....
./bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0
....


=== Setting up a Development Environment
Because apiman is a fairly standard maven project, it should be relatively easy
to import the project into Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.  For now we'll leave this
as an exercise for the reader.
