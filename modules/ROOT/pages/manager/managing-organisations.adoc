= Managing Organizations

Before any other actions can be taken an organization must exist.
All other operations take place within the context of an organization.

In order to create an organization click the 'Create a New Organization' link found on the dashboard page that appears when you first log in.

Simply provide an organization name and description and then click the 'Create Organization' button.
If successful you will be taken to the organization details page.

If you create multiple organizations, you can see the list of those organizations on your home page.
For example, you may click the 'Go to My Organizations' link from the dashboard page.
