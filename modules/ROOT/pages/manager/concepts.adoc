== API Manager

There are two layers to the API management project.

There is an API Manager which allows end users to centrally manage their APIs.
Additionally, there is an API Gateway which is responsible for applying those policies to API requests.

The API Manager allows end-users to track, configure, and share APIs with other users.
All of this is accomplished by the end user by logging into the API Manager user interface (or using the API Manager REST API).
