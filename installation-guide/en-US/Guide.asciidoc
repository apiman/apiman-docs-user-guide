:doctype: book

== Installation
This guide provides detailed information about how to install and configure apiman.

=== Installing in WildFly 8
The apiman project primarily targets WildFly 8 as a runtime environment.  In order to install
apiman you will need to download both WildFly 8 and the apiman overlay distribution.  Once
both are downloaded, it's a simple matter of unpacking both into the same location.

==== Download
First you will need to download both WildFly 8 and apiman:

* http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/8.2.0.Final/wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip[Download WildFly 8]
* http://downloads.jboss.org/apiman/1.1.9.Final/apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.9.Final-overlay.zip[Download apiman 1.1.9.Final]

....
curl http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/8.2.0.Final/wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip -o wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip
curl http://downloads.jboss.org/apiman/1.1.9.Final/apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.9.Final-overlay.zip -o apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.9.Final-overlay.zip
....

==== Unpack
Once both files have been downloaded, simply unpack both in the same location.

....
unzip wildfly-8.2.0.Final.zip
unzip -o apiman-distro-wildfly8-1.1.9.Final-overlay.zip -d wildfly-8.2.0.Final
....

==== Run WildFly 8
The apiman overlay contains everything needed to run apiman, including:

* apiman binaries (several WAR files)
* apiman-specific WildFly 8 configuration (*standalone-apiman.xml*)
* apiman rdbms datasource (h2)
* pre-configured *admin* user with password *admin123!*
* pre-configured h2 database for the API Manager (populated with default values)
* embedded Elasticsearch instance for metrics and gateway storage

For this reason, there is no additional configuration required to run apiman.  Simply start up
WildFly using the apiman configuration file:

....
cd wildfly-8.2.0.Final
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-apiman.xml
....


=== Installing in JBoss EAP 6.4
If you prefer to run apiman on a Red Hat supported application server, you can install it
into JBoss EAP 6.4.  In order to install apiman you will need to download both EAP and the apiman 
overlay distribution.  Once both are downloaded, it's a simple matter of unpacking both into the 
same location.

==== Download
First you will need to download both EAP 6.4 and apiman:

* http://www.jboss.org/products/eap/download/[Download EAP 6.4]
* http://downloads.jboss.org/apiman/1.1.9.Final/apiman-distro-eap64-1.1.9.Final-overlay.zip[Download apiman 1.1.9.Final]

==== Unpack
Once both files have been downloaded, simply unpack both in the same location (see the instructions
for Wildfly above).

==== Run EAP 6.4
The apiman overlay contains everything needed to run apiman, including:

* apiman binaries (several WAR files)
* apiman-specific EAP configuration (*standalone-apiman.xml*)
* apiman rdbms datasource (h2)
* pre-configured *admin* user with password *admin123!*
* pre-configured h2 database for the API Manager (populated with default values)
* embedded Elasticsearch instance for metrics and gateway storage

For this reason, there is no additional configuration required to run apiman.  Simply start up
EAP using the apiman configuration file:

....
cd jboss-eap*
./bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-apiman.xml
....


=== Installing using Docker
Another option when installing apiman is to use our docker image.  You're probably pretty
familiar with docker if you're going that route, but here is an example of how to start up
the apiman docker image:

....
docker pull jboss/apiman-wildfly
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 jboss/apiman-wildfly
....

[NOTE]
====
You can find apiman on https://registry.hub.docker.com/repos/apiman/[docker hub].
====

== Logging In
Once apiman is running, you should be able to log in to the API Manager by pointing your
browser at the following URL:

....
http://localhost:8080/apimanui/
....

You may log in with credentials *admin/admin123!*.
[NOTE]
====
We strongly advise that you immediately change the Keycloak admin user password, as well
as the "admin" user found in the "apiman" realm!!  ( you can do that by navigating to
http://localhost:8080/auth/admin/ )
====


== General Configuration
Of course apiman is made up of a number of different components, many of which can be configured
to use various implementations and/or providers.  When downloading and installing apiman, the
default distribution includes reasonable default values for all options.  This section details
these options and explains the default values.

=== Configuration Properties
All of the apiman WARs share a common configuration file called *apiman.properties*, which can
be found in *standalone/configuration*.  This file therefore contains configuration settings
for all three applications (API Manager, API Manager UI, API Gateway).

Please refer to the apiman.properties file itself, as well as this document, for more information
on each property's purpose and possible values.


=== API Manager Database
The API Manager, by default, is a typical CDI application and uses JPA/Hibernate to persist its data.  The
JPA layer requires a data source to connect to a supported database.  When running in WildFly this
datasource is made available by deploying the following file:

....
standalone/deployments/apiman-ds.xml
....

Out of the box this data source is usually a simple H2 configuration, but you can (of course) change
it to support whatever database you desire.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<datasources>
  <datasource jndi-name="jdbc/ApiManDT" pool-name="apiman-manager-api" enabled="true"
    use-java-context="true">
    <connection-url>jdbc:h2:${jboss.server.data.dir}${/}h2${/}apiman-manager-api;MVCC=true</connection-url>
    <driver>h2</driver>
    <security>
      <user-name>sa</user-name>
    </security>
  </datasource>
</datasources>
```

The project comes with DDLs for MySQL and PostgreSQL, to hopefully make it easy to switch away from H2.  Note
that switching databases also requires a change to the apiman.properties file.  The following should be 
changed to appropriate values for your database:

```
apiman.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
apiman.hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=validate
```

You can, of course, set the hbm2ddl property to "update" so that hibernate automatically creates the
database structure when it starts up.  Alternatively, the MySQL and PostgreSQL DDLs can be found in
*apiman/ddls/*.

=== API Gateway Registry
The API Gateway includes a registry that stores the published API and Client App information.
This registry is updated whenever a user publishes an API (or registers a Client App) from
within the API Manager UI.  The registry contains just the configuration information necessary for
the API Gateway to properly apply the appropriate policies to all inbound requests.

Out of the box, the API Gateway is configured to use Elasticsearch to store the
published/registered data.

The configuration of the Registry can be found in the *apiman.properties* file.

See section 4.2 for more information on modifying Elasticsearch settings.

=== API Gateway Rate Limiter
Part of the running apiman system is a "Rate Limiter" component.  This component is used by
apiman policies to enforce rate limits and uses Elasticsearch to store data.

The configuration of the Rate Limiter component can be found in the *apiman.properties*
file.

See section 4.2 for more information on modifying Elasticsearch settings.

=== API Gateway Shared State
Part of the running apiman system is a "Shared State" component.  This component is used by
apiman policies to share interesting state information across multiple requests.  The
shared state component uses Elasticsearch to store data.

The configuration of the Shared State component can be found in the *apiman.properties*
file.

See section 4.2 for more information on modifying Elasticsearch settings.

=== Gateway API Authentication
The Gateway's REST API is what the API Manager invokes when publishing APIs and Client Apps
to the Gateway.  This REST API should be protected, often using BASIC authentication.  By default,
the Gateway REST API requires BASIC authentication credentials, as well as a role of *apipublisher*.
In other words, the Gateway REST API can only be invoked by a valid user, and that user must have
the *apipublisher* role.


== HowTos
This section contains specific instructions for how to configure apiman for specific scenarios.
For example, it is possible to use Elasticsearch instead of Infinispan for certain API Gateway
components.  This section details how to make these sorts of changes.

=== How To:  Use Elasticsearch instead of an RDBMS in the API Manager
The apiman quickstart is configured (by default) to use JPA as the persistence technology for
storing all of its data.  But this isn't the only persistence technology supported.  Another
option is to use Elasticsearch instead.  This section details how to set up apiman for this
use-case.

==== High Level Overview
1. Download and install https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]
2. Make changes to "apiman.properties" to switch from JPA to Elasticsearch
3. (Re)start apiman!
4. Perform standard admin configuration of apiman (the database will of course be empty!)

==== Download and install Elasticsearch
This part is pretty easy - download the Elasticsearch software and get it running.  A very good
resource for this can be found here:

http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/getting-started.html

TIP: As of apiman 1.1.4.Final, an instance of Elasticsearch is included in the default
apiman distribution.  You may use it as your API Manager persistence store.  It is running
on port 19200.

==== Make changes to "apiman.properties"
Once Elasticsearch is running smoothly, you must make some changes to the *apiman.properties*
file in order to tell apiman to use ES instead of a database.  You should modify the
apiman.properties file to have the following properties set:

----
apiman.es.protocol=http
apiman.es.host=localhost
apiman.es.port=19200
apiman.es.username=
apiman.es.password=

apiman-manager.storage.type=es
apiman-manager.storage.es.protocol=${apiman.es.protocol}
apiman-manager.storage.es.host=${apiman.es.host}
apiman-manager.storage.es.port=${apiman.es.port}
apiman-manager.storage.es.username=${apiman.es.username}
apiman-manager.storage.es.password=${apiman.es.password}
apiman-manager.storage.es.initialize=true
----

Make sure you enter appropriate values for the apiman.es.protocol, apiman.es.host, and apiman.es.port
properties.  These values should reflect the settings of your Elasticsearch instance.

TIP: You can optionally also set the username and password - this is only useful if you are using 
something like Elasticsearch Shield to enable basic authentiation.

==== (Re)start apiman
If apiman was running, you should stop it now.  Once everything is shutdown, and the changes
to apiman.properties have been made, go ahead and start apiman up again.  It will pick up the
new settings in apiman.properties and attempt to use Elasticsearch instead of the database!

.Perform standard admin configuration
Note that the apiman quickstart comes pre-configured with a number of settings, including:

* Installed policy definitions
* Default configured roles (Organization Owner, API Developer, Appliation Developer)
* A default configured Gateway

This built-in configuration will be lost when you switch from JPA to Elasticsearch.  You will
need to use the apiman admin UI to reconfigure these settings.  Refer to the "System Administration"
section of the User Guide for more information on this.


=== How To:  Use a standalone Elasticsearch instance/cluster instead of the quickstart instance
The apiman quickstart ships by default with an embedded instance of Elasticsearch.  This is
suitable for getting up and running quickly, but is not a good long term solution.  Instead,
users are encouraged to install a standalone instance of Elasticsearch and point apiman to it.

==== High Level Overview
1. Download and install https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch]
2. Make changes to "apiman.properties" to point to your standalone Elasticsearch instance
3. (Re)start apiman!

==== Download and install Elasticsearch
This part is pretty easy - download the Elasticsearch software and get it running.  A very good
resource for this can be found here:

http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/getting-started.html

==== Make changes to "apiman.properties"
Once Elasticsearch is running smoothly, you must make some minor changes to the *apiman.properties*
file in order to tell apiman where your Elasticsearch instance is located.

There are a set of global properties used for all apiman components that use Elasticsearch to
load data.  These properties are:

----
apiman.es.protocol=http
apiman.es.host=localhost
apiman.es.port=19200
apiman.es.username=
apiman.es.password=
----

Make sure you enter appropriate values for this properties - they should reflect the settings 
of your Elasticsearch installation.

==== (Re)start apiman
If apiman was running, you should stop it now.  Once everything is shutdown, and the changes
to apiman.properties have been made, go ahead and start apiman up again.  It will pick up the
new settings in apiman.properties and attempt to use Elasticsearch instead of Infinispan.


=== How To:  Enable MTLS (Mutual SSL) Support for Endpoint Security
If you wish to use mutual SSL to ensure endpoint security between the apiman API Gateway and
your back-end API(s), you must update some settings in the apiman.properties file.

==== High Level Overview
1. Create Trust and Key Stores
2. Make changes to "apiman.properties" to switch from JPA to Elasticsearch
3. (Re)start apiman!
4. Configure one or more API to use MTLS

==== Create Trust and Key Stores
Please refer to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html[official JDK documentation]
to learn how to create and managed your SSL Trust and Key stores. Minimally a Keystore
is required in order to successfully utilise MTLS, and in many cases also a Truststore.

A *keystore* contains a given node's private key material, and must be kept safe.
Each node should have a unique key entry. For instance, a gateway should have its
own keystore, and each API likewise. In a production system, these keys should
be issued by a trusted certificate authority.

A *truststore* typically contains a set of certificate authorities which are trusted issuers.
Therefore, any certificate signed by the trusted CA would be trusted by the gateway. If
no truststore is explicitly provided to apiman the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html#cacerts[default trusted certificates]
provided by the JVM will be used. A typical use-case would be that an organization's
internal signing authority is marked as trusted within in the truststore,
and as the authority has been used to sign the certificate material in the keystores,
they will mutually trust each other by virtue of the issuer.

It is also possible to directly insert the *public/self-signed certificate* corresponding
to a given private key pair into a truststore, which works well at small scales and for development, but will
quickly cause the accumulation of a huge number of certificates in larger systems as
it requires a 1:1 mapping of certificates and private keys (rather than 1:N by using a trusted authority).

Your back-end APIs must be SSL enabled and *require authenticated client SSL connections*.
This means you must have server SSL certificates generated (and appropriate certificates and/or
CAs stored in your Trust Store).

==== Example Scenarios

There are many potential configuration permutations, but we'll outline a few simple ones here to
get you started.

===== Development Setup

In our hypothetical development setup, let's imagine we have two APIs and a single gateway.

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
.Simple Development MTLS Setup
|===
|Component
|Key Alias
|Truststore's Trusted Certificates

|Apiman Gateway
|gateway
|api_a.cer, api_b.cer

|API A
|api_a
|gateway.cer

|API B
|api_b
|gateway.cer

|===

.Walkthrough
* Generate a keystore and export a certificate for each component:

    ** Gateway:

      keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore gateway_ks.jks -alias gateway
      keytool -export -alias gateway -file gateway.cer -keystore gateway_ks.jks

    ** API A:

      keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore api_a_ks.jks -alias api_a
      keytool -export -alias api_a -file api_a.cer -keystore api_a_ks.jks

    ** API B:

      keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore api_b_ks.jks -alias api_b
      keytool -export -alias api_b -file api_b.cer -keystore api_b_ks.jks

* Import certificates into appropriate trust stores:

  ** Gateway:

    keytool -import -file api_a.cer -alias api_a -keystore gateway_ts.jks
    keytool -import -file api_b.cer -alias api_b -keystore gateway_ts.jks

  ** API A:

    keytool -import -file gateway.cer -alias gateway -keystore api_a_ts.jks

  ** API B:

    keytool -import -file gateway.cer -alias gateway -keystore api_b_ts.jks

Now simply set the appropriate paths to the keystore and truststore in
`apiman.properties` for the gateway, and set up your APIs with their respective
truststores and keystores (the specifics of how to do this will depend on your
API's implementation).

We will also set the following in `apiman.properties` to make our development
easier:

  apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.allowAnyHost=true

When you add your MTLS protected APIs into apiman, you should set the
`API Security` field to `MTLS/Two-Way-SSL`.

===== MTLS via Custom Certificate Authority

The previous approach works for development, but doesn't scale well, is harder to manage
and doesn't gracefully handle revocations, expiry, expansion, etc. Instead, let's
summarise a scenario where an organisation has an internal CA which they use to
sign APIs' certificates. The process for generating a CA and signing
certificates is out of scope for this guide, but is trivial to accomplish using
OpenSSL, LibreSSL, or similar.

Let's imagine we have a CA called `apimanCA`, and have *signed* the certificates
for each node.

[cols="3", options="header"]
.CA-based MTLS Setup
|===
|Component
|Signed Key Alias
|Truststore Contents

|Apiman Gateway
|gateway (signed by apimanCA)
|apimanCA.cer

|API A
|api_a (signed by apimanCA)
|apimanCA.cer

|API N
|api_n (signed by apimanCA)
|apimanCA.cer

|===

Despite the initial administrative work setting up the CA and signing the
certificates, this process is drastically less effort to maintain in large
deployments. Only the trusted CA needs to be in the truststore, and any
certificates signed by it are trusted by virtue of this.

==== Make changes to "apiman.properties"
Once you have your Trust Store and Key Store properly configured, you must
configure your apiman.properties file.  Here is a summary of the properties:

Omit any properties which are not relevant to you, with the exception of
`trustStore`, which is mandatory for MTLS.

----
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# SSL/TLS settings for the gateway connector(s).
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Trust store contains certificate(s) trusted by gateway.
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.trustStore=<PATH_TO_TRUST_STORE>
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.trustStorePassword=<PASSWORD_IF_ANY>

# Key store contains gateway's keys (including private components: keep it safe).
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.keyStore=<PATH_TO_KEY_STORE>
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.keyStorePassword=<PASSWORD_IF_ANY> # Password on key store as a whole
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.keyPassword=<PASSWORD_IF_ANY> # Password on specific key(s)
# By default all keys can be used (will try all). If alias list provided, will only attempt to use listed keys.
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.keyAliases=<COMMA_SEPARATED_LIST>

# Allowed TLS/SSL protocols and ciphers suites as CSV. Availability will vary depending on your JVM impl.
# Uses JVM defaults depending if not explicitly provided.
# See: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.allowedProtocols=TLSv1.2,TLSv1.1
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.allowedCiphers=TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA

# Whether certificate host checks should be bypassed. *Use with great care.*
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.allowAnyHost=false

# Whether self-signed certificates should be automatically trusted. *Use with great care.*
apiman-gateway.connector-factory.tls.allowSelfSigned=false
----

CAUTION: The settings chosen here have significant security implications. Best practice
guides are https://www.owasp.org/[available at OWASP].

==== (Re)start apiman
If apiman was running, you should stop it now.  Once everything is shutdown, and the changes
to apiman.properties have been made, go ahead and start apiman up again.

==== Configure one or more API to use MTLS
Now that the apiman MTLS feature has been configured, use the Manager UI to enable MTLS in
one or more API.  This can be done on the "Implementation" tab when you are configuring
the details of your back-end endpoint (URL, type, and endpoint security).


=== How To:  Use an External Keycloak Authentication Server
The apiman quickstart overlay comes with an embedded version of Keycloak that we use for
authentication.  You may already have a Keycloak instance that you use.  This section 
explains how to modify apiman to use yours instead of ours.

==== High Level Overview
1. Create the apiman Realm in Keycloak
2. Configure the API Manager UI client in Keycloak
3. Point apiman at the remote Keycloak

==== Create the apiman Realm in Keycloak
You'll need to make sure you create the *apiman* realm in your Keycloak server.  A
quick way to do that is to use the Keycloak admin console to import the apiman 
realm file located here:

https://github.com/apiman/apiman/blob/master/distro/data/src/main/resources/data/apiman-realm.json

==== Configure the API Manager UI client in Keycloak
Once the apiman realm has been created or imported, make sure to configure the 
*Valid Redirect URIs* section of the *apimanui* client.  The default value of 
"/apimanui/*" must be replaced with the full public URL of your API Manager UI.
For example, the value may be something like:

    https://apiman.myorg.com/apimanui/*

TIP: Don't forget the "*" wildcard at the end of the URL.

==== Point apiman at the remote Keycloak
Finally, you must modify the *standalone-apiman.xml* configuration file to point
apiman at the remote Keycloak server.  Make sure you know the full public URL of
your Keycloak server and add it to the following section of *standalone-apiman.xml*:

```xml
<kc:realm xmlns:kc="urn:jboss:domain:keycloak:1.0" name="apiman">
  <kc:realm-public-key>MIGf..snip..QAB</kc:realm-public-key>
  <kc:auth-server-url>https://keycloak-host.org:8443/auth</kc:auth-server-url>
  <kc:ssl-required>none</kc:ssl-required>
  <kc:enable-cors>false</kc:enable-cors>
  <kc:principal-attribute>preferred_username</kc:principal-attribute>
</kc:realm>
```

TIP: If you manually created the apiman realm in Keycloak, you will also need to 
copy the realm's public key into <kc:realm-public-key> above.
